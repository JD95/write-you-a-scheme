# write-you-a-scheme

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT READY TO USE AS LEARNING MATERIAL

The inspiration for this project is of course the original [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours/Conclusion), however this version will take a different approach. Instead of aiming to be a project for absolute Haskell beginners, it will be geared towards those who already know the basics and want exposure and practice with some of the more advanced concepts in the language.

This project assumes knowledge of:
- Basics of using stack (building project and running tests)
- How to make a function
- What a type signature is
- Case statements
- Arithmetic
- Lambdas
- Basics of Typeclasses and familiarity with classes like Show, Eq, etc.
- Familiarity with the functions of Data.List
- User defined product and sum types

Unlike the original, a parser for scheme will be included in the starter project. It goes without saying that most of the project's focus will instead by spent on evaluation and user interaction.

By the end of the project you'll have experience with:
- Useful Functor types (Maybe, Either, State, IO)
- Monads
- Recursion Schemes
- Files
